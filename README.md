# Reci-Help

The goal of this project is to create a web application:
    -To serve staff in a kitchen and management enviornment
    -To be used in a browser and eventually on an Android tablet
    -To store the following information in a database:
        -Ingredients
        -Ingredient Prices
        -Recipes
        -Recipe comments
        -User comments on recipes

Access to the application will be divided into admin and users.
An admin should be able to directly edit information in the database, pull all of the database informatin into
a spreadsheet, and utilize all of the users' capabilities.
A user should be able to access individual recipes, make personal comments on recipes in a "forum" like manner,
and also pull up recipe information in a readable and printable format with options to change batch size or
specific unit conversions (imperial or metric).
